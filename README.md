# Bike Sales Dashboard

# PROJECT DISCRIPTION

For this project, I analyzed data from a bike company to figure out what influences customers when they're deciding to buy. The end result is a dashboard that shows all the important info about bike sales. With this dashboard, stakeholders can see trends, spot patterns, and use that info to make smart decisions.

# DATA SOURCING

• After downloading the dataset in Excel, we create three new sheets:

• Working Sheet: This is a duplicate of the original data. Here, we can clean up the data without worrying about making changes to the raw table.

• Pivot Calculation Sheet: We use this sheet to create Pivot Tables based on what we need for analysis.

• Dashboard Sheet: This is where we put all the visualizations and slicers to filter our data for analysis.

# DATA CLEANING AND TRANFORMATION

To start, we checked the dataset for any issues with the data quality.
We did the following steps:

• Removing Duplicates, Unwanted Cells, and Irrelevant Columns: We got rid of any duplicate rows, cells we didn't need, and columns that weren't relevant to our analysis.

• Replacing Values with More Meaningful Entries: We used the Find and Replace function to replace abbreviations with clearer labels. For example, we changed "M" to "Married" in the "MaritalStatus" column and "F" to "Female" in the "Gender" column.

• Changing the Data Type of the "Income" Column: We converted the "Income" column to currency format so that it's easier to read and work with.

• Creating Age Brackets: We made three different age brackets based on the "Age" column using the Nested IF function. This helped us categorize age groups for analysis. 

# DATA ANALYSIS

We made three pivot tables to summarize the data and find trends in the dataset. We wanted to see how factors like average income per purchase, customer commute, and customer age bracket relate to bike purchases.

Here's a glimpse of what those pivot tables look like in Excel.

# DATA VISUALIZATION

We finished by creating a dashboard. We inserted and adjusted pivot charts based on the pivot tables we made earlier. This helped make the dashboard user-friendly and interactive.
To make it even easier to use, we added three "Slicers." These let users filter the data quickly and see specific information they're interested in.
Here's a preview of what the final dashboard looks like in Excel.

# INSIGHT

Here are some insights from the analysis of bike purchasers:

• Both men and women with higher average incomes in their respective categories were more inclined to buy bikes.

• The majority of bike purchasers fell into the 31-54 age bracket, which is considered the middle age group.

• People with commutes of 0-1 mile were most likely to buy a bike, followed by those with commutes of 2-5 miles. However, those with commutes of 5 miles or more were less likely to make a purchase.

• Homeowners were more likely to purchase bikes compared to renters.

• Professionals made up the largest portion of bike customers.

 # RECOMMENDATION BASED ON ANALYSIS

The middle age group (ages 31-54) makes the most bike purchases, so the management should concentrate their efforts on targeting this demographic.

There's a clear trend: as the distance of commuters increases, their preference for biking decreases. This suggests that the company should prioritize marketing to short-distance commuters.
